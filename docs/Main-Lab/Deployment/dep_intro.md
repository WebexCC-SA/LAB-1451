    This lab consists of two main sections. The first provides a brief introduction to deploying customizations in 
    Control Hub. The second section focuses on using CE-Deploy. As Control Hub continues to expand its deployment options, 
    not every feature can be managed in bulk. However, third-party tools like CE-Deploy can help fill these gaps.
    
    If you have never used CE-Deploy before, this is a great introduction. For those already familiar with it, this lab offers 
    a useful refresher and an opportunity to explore new features such as the CE Macro Editor Pro.
