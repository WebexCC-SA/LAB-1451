    This lab demonstrated the end-to-end process of configuring devices in Control Hub and streamlining deployments using 
    CE-Deploy. Participants gained hands-on experience with provisioning and managing Cisco Webex devices, applying 
    configuration settings, and ensuring they operate within organizational standards. CE-Deploy simplified the bulk 
    configuration process, reduced setup time, and ensured consistency across devices. Overall, the lab highlighted how 
    leveraging Control Hub’s centralized management with CE-Deploy’s automation capabilities enhances deployment efficiency, 
    minimizes errors, and accelerates the readiness of collaboration environments.
